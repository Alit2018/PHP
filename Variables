Looks like in PHP the three major variables are :

<?php
	$mynumber = 1;
	$mystring = “Hellow”;
	$myarray = (“One”,”Two”,”Three”);
	
	echo "Looks like the PHP has 3 variables” . $mynumber . $mystring . $myarray
	print “Looks like the PHP has 3 variables” . $mynumber . $mystring . $myarray
?>

In Python:

width = 10
length = 10
figure = ’figure’
array=[“cicle”,”rectangular”,”square”,”oval"]
print(figure, width, length, array[2])
